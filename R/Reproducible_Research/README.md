# Analysis of severe weather events in the USA (1950-2011)

This is the final project of the [Reproducible Research Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research) offered by Johns Hopkins University on 
the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) platform.

The paper will present an analysis of climate events based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

There are two files:
- storms_usa.Rmd: Contains the scripts and descriptions that create the report through R Markdown;
- storms_usa.pdf: PDF report generated from the .Rmd file using the `knitr()` function in R.

You can also access the report on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/viamatias/climate_events_usa).
