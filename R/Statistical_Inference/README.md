# Statistical Inference

This is the final project of the [Statistical Inference Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference) offered by Johns Hopkins University on 
the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) platform.

The project aims to carry out two different analyzes and report them. The first report analyzes the central limit theorem applied to exponential functions, while the second uses statistical inference techniques to analyze the factors that influence tooth growth.

There are four files:
- central_limit_theorem.Rmd: Contains the scripts and descriptions that create the first report through R Markdown;
- central_limit_theorem.pdf: First PDF report generated from the .Rmd file using the `knitr()` function in R.
- tooth_growth_inference.Rmd: Contains the scripts and descriptions that create the second report through R Markdown;
- tooth_growth_inference.pdf : Second PDF report generated from the .Rmd file using the `knitr()` function in R.

You can also access the report on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/viamatias/tooth_growth).
