# Motor Trend

This is the final project of the [Regression Models Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models) 
offered by Johns Hopkins  University in the 
[Coursera Plataform](https://www.coursera.org/). 

The paper's objective is to review a collection of cars and explore the relationship that explains quantitatively the miles per gallon spent. 
To do this will be used strategies of Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Models.

There are two files:
- motor_trend.Rmd: Contains the scripts and descriptions that create the report through R Markdown;
- motor_trend.pdf: PDF report generated from the .Rmd file using the `knitr()` function in R.

You can also access the report on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/viamatias/motor_trend).
